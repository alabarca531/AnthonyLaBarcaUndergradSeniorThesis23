  abstract  = {In this paper, I propose a new algorithm for self-organizing a multilayered neural network which has an ability to recognize patterns based on the geometrical similarity of their shapes. This network, whose nickname is "neo-cognitron", has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of a photoreceptor layer followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells", which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The input synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We don't need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After completion of self-organization, the stimulus patterns has become to elicit their own response from the last C-cell layer. That is, the response of the last C-cell layer changes without fail, if a stimulus patterns of a different category is presented to the input layer. The response of that layer, however, is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a certain amount of changes of the pattern's shape or size.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we demonstrate that finite linear combinations of compositions of a fixed, univariate function and a set of affine functionals can uniformly approximate any continuous function ofn real variables with support in the unit hypercube; only mild conditions are imposed on the univariate function. Our results settle an open question about representability in the class of single hidden layer neural networks. In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity. The paper discusses approximation properties of other possible types of nonlinearities that might be implemented by artificial neural networks.},

  abstract     = {{We have designed, developed, and applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using multi-task learning to search for and characterize strong H i Ly$\alpha$ absorption in quasar spectra. Without any explicit modelling of the quasar continuum or application of the predicted line profile for Ly$\alpha$ from quantum mechanics, our algorithm predicts the presence of strong H i absorption and estimates the corresponding redshift zabs and H i column density \\$N\_\\{\\rm H\\,\\small \\{I\\}\\}\\$, with emphasis on damped Ly$\alpha$ systems (DLAs, absorbers with \\$N\_\\{\\rm H\\,\\small \\{I\\}\\}\\ge 2 \\times 10^\\{20\\} \\, \\{\\rm cm^\\{-2\\}\\}\\$). We tuned the CNN model using a custom training set of DLAs injected into DLA-free quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), data release 5 (DR5). Testing on a held-back validation set demonstrates a high incidence of DLAs recovered by the algorithm (97.4 per cent as DLAs and 99 per cent as an H i absorber with \\$N\_\\{\\rm H\\,\\small \\{I\\}\\}\\&gt; 10^\\{19.5\\} \\, \\{\\rm cm^\\{-2\\}\\}\\$) and excellent estimates for zabs and \\$N\_\\{\\rm H\\,\\small \\{I\\}\\}\\$. Similar results are obtained against a human-generated survey of the SDSS DR5 data set. The algorithm yields a low incidence of false positives and negatives but is challenged by overlapping DLAs and/or very high \\$N\_\\{\\rm H\\,\\small \\{I\\}\\}\\$ systems. We have applied this CNN model to the quasar spectra of SDSS DR7 and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (data release 12) and provide catalogues of 4913 and 50 969 DLAs, respectively (including 1659 and 9230 high-confidence DLAs that were previously unpublished). This work validates the application of deep learning techniques to astronomical spectra for both classification and quantitative measurements.}},

@article{Kiranyaz2021,
  abstract     = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.},

@article{Vincenzi2019,
	abstract = {{The design and analysis of time-domain sky surveys require the ability to simulate accurately realistic populations of core-collapse supernova (SN) events. We present a set of spectral time-series templates designed for this purpose, for both hydrogen-rich (Type II, IIn, and IIb) and stripped-envelope (Type Ib, Ic, and Ic-BL) core-collapse SNe. We use photometric and spectroscopic data for 67 core-collapse SNe from the literature, and for each generate a time-series spectral template. The techniques used to build the templates are fully data driven with no assumption of any parametric form or model for the light curves. The template-building code is open source, and can be applied to any transient for which well-sampled multiband photometry and multiple spectroscopic observations are available. We extend these spectral templates into the near-ultraviolet to λ ≃ 1600 {\AA} using observer-frame ultraviolet photometry. We also provide a set of templates corrected for host galaxy dust extinction, and provide a set of luminosity functions that can be used with our spectral templates in simulations. We give an example of how these templates can be used by integrating them within the popular SN simulation package snana, and simulating core-collapse SNe in photometrically selected cosmological Type Ia SN samples, prone to contamination from core-collapse events.}},

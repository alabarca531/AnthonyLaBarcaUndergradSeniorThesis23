# OUTLINE FOR SENIOR THESIS

## OUTLINE FOR INTRODUCTION

1. Quick introduction of topic
   1.1. Traditional methods of identifying problematic data
   1.2. Machine Learning applied to more and more mundane tasks
2. Problem statement
   2.1. What is the problem?
   2.2. Why is it important?
3. Scope
   3.1. What is the current landscape?
   3.2. How does this fit into that landscape
4. Objectives
   4.1. What does this add to the current landscape?
5. Structure of the thesis
   5.1. What is the structure of the thesis?

## OUTLINE FOR BACKGROUND

1. Supernovae
   1.1. Types of supernovae
   1.2. Supernova classification
   1.3. Supernova light curves
2. Previous Attempts at Machine Learning
   2.1 CNN Used in other applications
   2.2. 1D CNN currently in use at DESI
   2.3. 2D CNN developed last year
3. Advancements in Machine Learning (Why move to transformers)
   3.1. Transformers
   3.2. Vision Transformers (ViT)
   3.3. Self-Attention (VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS)

## OUTLINE FOR Validity of Transformers for Spectral Classification

1. Proof of concept for obvious features
2. Creation of $\texttt{GenData}$ class
3. Generation of spectral dataset
4. Classification of dataset

## OUTLINE FOR APPLICATION TO DESI

1. ViT V1 -- Same dataset as CNN
   1.1 ViT V1.0: De-redshifted data
   1.2 ViT V1.5: Try down sampling
   1.3 Which performs better? Is there incentive?
2. ViT V2 -- Redshift data!
   2.1 ViT V2.0: Test on CNN as well
   2.2 Performance?
